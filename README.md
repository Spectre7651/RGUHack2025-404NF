# RGUHack2025 Team 404 Not Found

#### Welcome to our attempt at the Elementz Challenge of RGU Hack 2025

#### Our Team:
Our team consisted of myself a 1st Year Cyber Security student and my friend Brodie who is a 1st year Accounting Student

I have a decent knowledge of coding in general with most of my experience being with Python and scripting 'languages' such as bash where Brodie has no prior experience with any coding leanguage!
Therfore our submission is fairly basic as I had to learn how to make API requests in python and parse JSON data.

#### The Tech:
Our tech stack is pretty basic, the whole backend is python which creates a flask webserver to host the login page and the map page itself the backend then calls the Elementz api we had access to at the event and then the python parses the returned data and uses the relevant data to plot it onto the map using the Google Maps API.

There is also some extra code which is the start of a 3D globe version however we didn't persue it due to the time constraints and just been very tired!

##### Anyway we both enjoyed our first RGUHack and will absolutely take part again just with a bigger team so we can get more done!
##### A huge thank you to the RGU Computing Society, RGU SoCET and Elementz for the amazing 24 hours!
